A circuit created with a photoelectric resistor and three LEDs. 

The photoelectric resistor detects the amount of light from a light source via an analog pin. 
Depending on the intensity of the light the circuit will light up one of three LEDs: 
red, blue, or green. The red LED for being the most intense reading of light.
The blue LED for the least intense reading of light. Lastly, the green LED lights up when 
the intensity of the light source is not at its greatest nor its lowest.
