In this project a joystick is used to control a servo. 

The joystick (2 potientometer positioned perpendicular to each other) controls the 180 degree range of the servo.
The joystick provides an analog input from anywhere from 0-1023 which is then translated to a pulswidth that is used
to control the servo.
