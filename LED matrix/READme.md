A circuit with four LEDs setup on a bread board in a 2x2 matrix configuration.

The circuit receives an analog input from a joystick (2 potentiometers positioned perpendicular to each other).
Depending on this analog input of the joystick an LED in the matrix will light up. 
Furthermore, there is a master switch that can turn on and off all the LEDs in the circuit clicking the top of the joystick.
